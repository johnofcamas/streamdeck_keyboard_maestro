# StreamDeck <-> Keyboard Maestro
A Streamdeck plugin for Keyboard Maestro integration

This is *not* redistributable, since Python relies on some libraries

## Below is a VERY basic getting started

NOTE: feel free to create an issue if you have specific questions.  As always you can create a pull request to improve things... I really would love community help.

## Prerequisites:

```
python 3.6+
pip install websocket-client
pip install websockets
```

* Look over the manifest.json to make sure it's configured to your liking
* Change the variables at the top of `main.py` to your plugin location

I'm moving my TODO's to the Issues tracker
